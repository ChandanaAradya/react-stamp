# @thoughtclan/react-stamp

A Node.js server component to generate images from the canvas generated by [`react-stamp`](../README.md).

## Usage

There are two options for utilising this feature:
1. Run [`server.js`](./server.js) which runs an Express HTTP server which can receive canvas JSON at `/create-image` and processes to create an image
2. Run the main [`index.js](./index.js) in a shell passing it the necessary parameters to source the JSON and output an image file

Note that this component relies on an unmodified [example app](../example) being present in the same parent directory. The script uses
the example app to render the canvas and generate an image.
